In this project, I implement a Perceptron on a linearly separable dataset which 
is generated by the function fake data(). The, to evaluate a Perceptron solution, 
I wrote a function classify(S, z), returning class labels. After developing the 
Perceptron function perceptrain(S,y), I trained it on both training and test 
datasets. Finally, I converted the data and the vectors back to 2-D for data 
visualization using the ggplot2 package showing the final classifier perceptron 
and the trajectory of the algorithm.
